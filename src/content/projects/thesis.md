## Description

My Thesis is about procedural terrain generation in Unity using Compute shaders on the GPU. The terrain is based on 2D heightmapts created from procedurally generated river networks. These heightmaps are then combined with into a density funciton with 3D noise. The terrain mesh data is generated using a GPU compute shader implementation of marching cubes.
