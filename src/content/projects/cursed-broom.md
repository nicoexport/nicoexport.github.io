## Descripton

Fly, teleport, and jump through increasingly challenging levels. With the broom, the hat, and the enchanted shoes, you unlock powers that turn every movement into an exciting experience. Master the art of flying and discover new ways to outsmart every obstacle. But be careful, it looks like the broom isn’t working as intended.

## My Contributions

Cursed Broom is the first commercial title i was able to work on as a developer. 

I worked on: 
- Save System
- Automated import pipeline from Aseprite to Unity for animations and tilesets
- Various gameplay programming tasks
